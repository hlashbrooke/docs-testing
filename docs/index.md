# Discourse Documentation

Testing out MkDocs for Discourse product documentation.

This is a basic MkDocs install that is synced to [a GitHub repo](https://github.com/hlashbrooke/docs-testing). Updates in the main branch of the repo are automatically deployed here, so it's easy to keep the content updated via git. 

 Each doc is stored as a separate markdown file and new docs can be added by creating new files. Categories are defined by the folder structre and tags can be added as meta data in file headers.

 It took me a little while to set this up, but someone more used to this kind of thing could probably do it pretty quickly.

 For now, I've added a few docs from Meta and I'll add more docs in here next week to get a better feel for how it works with tiered categories and more content.
